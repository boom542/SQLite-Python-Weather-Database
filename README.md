<h1>SQLite Weather Database using Python</h1> 
This is a work in progress and probably very bad.

Should create and update an SQL database for capital countriesâ€™ weather using OpenWeatherMap.

This has Menus and Terminal flags.

Menu Example:
```
Choose what you want to do 

1) Get weather data
2) Update Forecast
3) Create lists.
4) Exit 
```

Example of the flag in use: `python "Capital Weather Database.py" -update`

<h2>Requirements and info</h2>
Requires a Recent version of Python. Written for 3.11 but should work for anything similar
Tested on Linux. Should work with most other systems with python support.
Requires PyMenu: `pip install pymenu-console`
Menu Requires around 40 lines of text

TODO: Add average calculation eventually.
