<h1>SQLite Weather Database using Python</h1> 
This is a work in progress and probably very bad.

Creates and updates an SQL database for capital countriesâ€™ weather using OpenWeatherMap.
Allows the User to do basic filtering for weather and calculate the average temperature of those filtered options.

This has Menus and Terminal flags. It also has a basic web interface.

Menu Example:
```
Choose what you want to do 

1) Get weather data
2) Update Forecast
3) Create lists.
4) Exit 
```
Available flags:
```
-update: Create and update the database.
-tui: Use the terminal instead of the web interface.
```

Example of the flag in use: `python "Capital Weather Database.py" -update`
