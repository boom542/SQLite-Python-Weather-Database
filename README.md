<h1>SQLite Weather Database using Python</h1> 
This is a work in progress and probably very bad.

Creates and updates an SQL database for capital countriesâ€™ weather using OpenWeatherMap.
Allows the User to do basic filtering for weather and calculate the average temperature of those filtered options.

This has Menus and Terminal flags.

Menu Example:
```
Choose what you want to do 

1) Get weather data
2) Update Forecast
3) Create lists.
4) Exit 
```

Example of the flag in use: `python "Capital Weather Database.py" -update`
